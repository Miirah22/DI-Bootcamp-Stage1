// For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command.
// Of course, explain each prediction.
// Then run the expression in the console. Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.
// Using the code below:
// let c;
//     let a = 34;
//     let b = 21;
// What will be the outcome of a + b in the first expression ?
//console.log(a+b)
55

// What will be the outcome of a + b in the second expression ?
//a = 2,
//console.log(a+b)

55

// What is the value of c?

undefined - //it exits but has no value and have been declared somewhere.

// Analyse the code below, what will be the outcome?

//console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
