/*Hint: if statement (tomorrow’s lesson)

Prompt the user for a number. Depending on the users number you will return a string of the word “Boom”. Follow the rules below:

If the number given is less than 2 : return “boom”
If the number given is bigger than 2 : the string should include n number of “o”s (n being the number given)
If the number given is evenly divisible by 2, add a exclamation mark to the end.
If the number given is evenly divisible by 5, return the string in ALL CAPS.
If the number given is evenly divisible by both 2 and 5, return the string in ALL CAPS and add an exclamation mark to the end.*/

let num = (30);         let strWord = ("Boom");         let nNum = '0';
let user = prompt(num);

if (num > 2){
    //return = ("Boo"+nNum+"m" );
}
else if (num < 2);
{
    return=(strWord);
}
