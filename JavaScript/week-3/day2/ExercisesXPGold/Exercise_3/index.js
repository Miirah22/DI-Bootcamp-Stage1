// Make a Calculator. Follow the instructions:

    //Prompt the user for the first number.

    let firstNum = (56);
    let user = prompt(firstNum);
    console.log(user);

    //Store the first number in a variable called num1.

    let num1 = 56;

    //Hint : console.log the type of the variable num1. What should you do to convert it to a number ?

    console.log(num1);

    //Prompt the user for the second number.

    let secondNum = (23);
    let user1 = prompt(secondNum);
    console.log(user1);

    //Store the second number in a variable called num2.

    let num2 = 23;

    //Create an Alert where the value is the SUM of num1 and num2.

    let sum = (num1 + num2);
    alert("sum of num1 + num2 = " + sum);
    
    //BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide! 
        
    let amount = (200);      let quantity = (8.5);
    alert(amount * quantity);
    alert(amount / quantity);
